		1. Know your strengths and weaknesses
	</h1>
	<br />
	<p>The first step to becoming a better leader is to understand yourself. What are your core values, skills, and goals? What are your areas of improvement and blind spots? How do you cope with stress, feedback, and conflict? You can use various tools, such as personality tests, 360-degree reviews, or coaching sessions, to gain more insights into your strengths and weaknesses. Then, you can leverage your strengths and work on your weaknesses to enhance your leadership potential.</p>
	<br />
	<h1 class="display-4">
		2. Define your vision and expectations
	</h1>
	<br />
	<p>The second step to becoming a better leader is to clarify your vision and expectations for yourself and your team. What is the purpose and direction of your work? What are the objectives and milestones you want to achieve? How do you measure success and progress? How do you align your work with the organization's mission and values? You need to communicate your vision and expectations clearly and consistently to your team, and ensure that they understand and share them. This will help you create a sense of cohesion and commitment among your remote team members.</p>
	<br />

		3. Adapt your communication style
	</h1>
	<br />
	<p>The third step to becoming a better leader is to adapt your communication style to your remote work context. How do you communicate with your team and other stakeholders? What are the best channels and tools to use? How often and how much do you communicate? How do you balance between formal and informal communication? How do you convey your tone, emotions, and intentions? You need to consider these questions and adjust your communication style accordingly. You also need to listen actively, ask open-ended questions, give constructive feedback, and acknowledge achievements and challenges.</p>
